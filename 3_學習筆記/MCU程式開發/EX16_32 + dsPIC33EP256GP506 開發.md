### MCC EX16/32 DEMO功能

Explorer16/32 Demo Overview
 

This demo is intended to be used with the General Purpose controller modules while plugged into the Explorer 16/32 Development Board 
This firmware code generated by the projects provides a basic demonstration of how to use the board with general purpose processor.  

Demo Overview
 
During execution, the demo performs the following operations: 

1. Periodically takes ADC measurements on the poteniometer on the Explorer 16/32 and prints the results to the LCD screen. 
2. Real time value is displayed on the LCD. 
3. Blinks an LED. 
4. Toggles an LED on switch press 
The demo has only one primary operating mode:

In this operating in mode , the RTCC value update do not interrupt/interfere with the other application operations (such as ADC POT measurements and LCD printing). LED blinks at a constant rate indicating that the application has not stuck anywhere. In application on pressing a dedicated switch LED gets turned ON,on releasing this switch the LED gets turned OFF. 

When Explorer16/32 board and the demo module are loaded in MCC, this demo module will be loaded with default on Explorer16/32 on board dependent modules, one can change these dependent modules at any point of time. 

Once the demo is loaded without the board, all the board dependent modules gets loaded and it is user configurable i,e pins are not auto selected , in this condition Explorer16/32 demo can be used on the customized board provided proper device selection.
